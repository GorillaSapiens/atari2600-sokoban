bank_F4 is the game
levels has a bunch of sokoban levels
ATTIC is probably useless
ursoup.asm is not relevant, it is a skeleton 2600 program that does nothing

macro.h and vcs.h came with DASM somewhere somehow.  who knows?

deepthought.h is my own, uses RIOT timer to marshal vertical blanking processing time.

timing.pl might print stuff for asm files?  i don't remember
